## Creating Project Pages manually

If you're familiar with command-line git, it's straightforward to manually add
a new set of Project Pages.

###  Make a fresh clone

To set up Project Pages, you need to create a new "orphan" branch (a branch
that has no common history with an existing branch) in your repository. The
safest way to do this is to start with a fresh clone:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/_user_/_repository_.git
    # Clone our repository
    # Cloning into '_repository_'...
    # remote: Counting objects: 2791, done.
    # remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1225/1225), done.
    # remote: Total 2791 (delta 1722), reused 2513 (delta 1493)
    # Receiving objects: 100% (2791/2791), 3.77 MiB | 969 KiB/s, done.
    # Resolving deltas: 100% (1722/1722), done.
```

###  Create a gh-pages branch

Once you have a clean repository, you'll need to create the new branch and
remove all content from the working directory and index:
```bash
    cd _repository_
    
    git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    # Creates our branch, without any parents (it's an orphan!)
    # Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages'
    
    git rm -rf .
    # Remove all files from the old working tree
    # rm '.gitignore'
```

**Tip**: The `gh-pages` branch won't appear in the list of branches generated by `git branch` until you make your first commit.

###  Add content and push

Now you have an empty working directory. You can create some content in this
branch and push it to GitHub. For example:
```bash
    echo "My GitHub Page" > index.html
    git add index.html
    git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
    git push origin gh-pages
``` 

**Tip**: After the first push, it can take up to ten minutes before the Page content is available.

###  Load your new Page

After your push to the `gh-pages` branch, your Project Page will be available
at `username.github.io/projectname`. Enterprise Pages will be available at
`username.[domain]/projectname`. To set up a custom domain for Pages, see
[this article](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-
with-pages).
